	<li class = "sotired">Depending on the choices you make, you will be able to expand your empire by conquering provinces. These provinces will become part of your empire and another responsibility of yours. </li>
	
	<li class = "sotired">Each turn you will be able to view a menu of options corresponding to a number.

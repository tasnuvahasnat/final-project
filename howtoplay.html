	<h2> How to Play </h2>

<ul>
	<li class = "sotired">When you begin the game, you will be prompted to create a character and empire name. You will also have access to a main menu with a few options to view: a military menu, a province management menu, status graphs, and a war menu. </li>
	
	<li class = "sotired">You will also have the option to end your turn and access your annual event. Events will occur annually and offer you a chance to choose an option in response to an event. Your decision will impact your army size, morale, or wealth. You will be given one event each turn.</li>
	
	<li class = "sotired">Depending on the choices you make, you will be able to expand your empire by conquering provinces. These provinces will become part of your empire and another responsibility of yours. Once one of your provinces border an enemy's provinces, you will be able to trade with or declare war against them. </li>
	
	<li class = "sotired">Each turn you will be able to view a menu of options corresponding to a number. You will input a number which will either show you a military menu, allow you to manage your provinces, make declarations of war, and show you graphs of your army size, morale, and wealth. You may also input a number to proceed to the next turn. </li>
</ul>

	<h2> Status Changes </h2>

<ul>
	<li class = "sotired"><b> On age:</b> You will live from 18 to 96 years old. The older you are, the higher your score. You may die in response to events and lose the game; so, choose wisely. </li>
	
	<li class = "sotired"><b> On wealth:</b> You begin with 11 wealth points. If you begin to go in dept, the morale of your people will begin declining as a penalty. If you still fail to increase wealth, your empire will collapse and the game will be over. </li>
	
	<li class = "sotired"><b> On empire size/provinces:</b> There are 16 provinces. Some will be claimed by two competing empires. You will be able to claim provinces using your free troops, these will be able to move around throughout the empire. The game starts with 2 free troops. Your competitor will have provinces that are green. Your provinces will be blue. You can increase the amount of troops during any turn. </li>

	<li class = "sotired"><b> On military troops:</b> You begin with 2 free troops situated throughout your empire. You will be given chances to move your troops, increase the amount of troops, and view how many troops per province through the province management menu.</li>
	
	<li class = "sotired"><b> On morale:</b> Morale is dependent on the happiness of your subjects. Your people begin with a morale of 70. If this number goes below 5, the likelihood of rebellions will increase. A rebellion may lead to you being overthrown and replaced. So, remember to keep your people happy. </li>
	<li class = "sotired"><b> On personal happiness:</b> Personal happiness is important. Make sure to take care of yourself because if your happiness becomes too low, you may die. </li>

<h2>How the Game Works</h2>
<ul>
	<li><b>random</b>: We used <i>random</i> to supply a random event to the player each turn. We also used it to program computer behavior </li>
	<li><b>matplotlib</b>: <i>matplotlib</i> was used to create graphs of the status for various global variables like: wealth, morale, and troop size.</li>
	<li><b>turtles</b>: We used turtles to create an interactive map that changes based on the player's actions during the game.</li>
	<li><b>lists and dictionaries</b>: All the events and possible outcomes were stored in dictionaries. This allowed us to access it through <i>random</i> and program status changes as the player progressed. We used lists to monitor status changes and add them to the status graphs. </li>
	<li><b>input</b>: Our game implemented <i>input</i> for the player's name, empire, and each decision made.</li>

</ul>
<h2>New Functions Used</h2>
<ul>
	<li><b>turtle.begin_fill(), turtle.end_fill()</b>: These function are used to get a turtle ready to color a shape and finish coloring a shape. We used it to identify which provinces are claimed to help the player plan their military strategy. </li>
</ul>
